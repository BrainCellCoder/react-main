ARCHITECTURE AND TECHNOLOGY STACK:
 Q1.Why did you choose the MERN stack for your e-commerce project?
 ANS: I chose the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) for my e-commerce project because 
      it provides modern framework for building scalable and efficient web applications. 

 Q2.What are the advantages of using MongoDB as the database?
 ANS:  MongoDB was selected as the database due to its flexibility and scalability for handling
       product catalog and user data.

 Q3.How did you handle the integration between the frontend (React) and backend (Node.js) components of your project?
 ANS: The frontend was developed using React for its component-based architecture and efficient rendering. 
      Node.js was used for the backend to ensure high-performance server-side operations and seamless integration 
      with the frontend components. The combination of these technologies allowed for a streamlined and consistent 
      development process.

 Q4.Did you consider any alternative technology stacks? If so, what were they and why did you ultimately choose MERN?
